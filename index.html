					<h1>LEAN into it</h1>
					<p>
						More data != Better
					</p>
					<p>
						No analytics: Act on gut, often fall to trends rather than usefulness, overly vocal early users and knee jerk ideas and reactions can lead you astray.
					</p>
					<p>
						Too many analytics: They recognize the importance of analytics, often to a fault. Constantly chasing their tail without a strategy. 

						What's your current goal? Measure that, and forget the rest. When the goal changes, your metrics change.

						Example product roadmap
						I’ll close out this post with an example roadmap for a product that roughly had the same featureset as Imageshack.us. You may end up making these product decision out-of-order of what I have them, but the philosophy remains the same: Build analytics only when you need them, and align them to the key efforts behind your product development process.
						
						Here’s an example sequencing of product development:
						
						1) Core product and features
						
							Obviously, you want people to be able to upload a photo and give a URL for it
							These photos then can be displayed on other sites
						
						1a) Analytics for core product
						
							First add Google analytics since it’s free :-)
							Build out a cohort matrix that tells you how many users join each week, how many come back, and what they do during their visits
							Where are these images being uploaded to? A breakdown of image displays by the domain they were displayed on would be nice
						
						2) Working on growing traffic
						
							Once you have the core product done, perhaps you want to make some whizbang features to grow traffic
							You might make a photo slideshow, or some awesome photo effects, etc.
							Also, you might want to make one-click integration with Typepad/MySpace/etc via something like Gigya
						
						2a) Analytics for traffic growth features
						
							One key issue to measure is how much additional traffic is gained by these different methods. You may want to start annotating visits that come to your site based on what kind of widget or photo created it. Do sparkly photo galleries generate the most visits? Why? Make a report
							Second feature might be an A/B testing framework. If you divide two groups, A and B, and show them different featuresets to see how the traffic grows for each
